# Feature Specification: Code Review and Governance Process

**Feature Branch**: `022-code-review-and-governance-process`
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Status**: Draft
**Dependencies**: 021-continuous-integration-and-quality-gates

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ensure Every PR Is Reviewed Before Merge (Priority: P1)

As a project maintainer, I am assured that no pull request reaches main without passing both automated review gates and an agent review so that code quality and constitution compliance are enforced consistently.

**Why this priority**: The constitution requires every PR to be reviewed by another agent and pass GCA/CodeRabbit gates. This is the primary governance enforcement surface.

**Independent Test**: Open a PR, verify that merge is blocked until GCA and CodeRabbit gates pass and an agent reviewer approves. Attempt merge without approval and confirm it is rejected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new pull request, **When** it is opened, **Then** GCA and CodeRabbit automated reviews are triggered within 5 minutes.
2. **Given** a PR with all CI gates passing but no agent review, **When** the author attempts to merge, **Then** the merge is blocked with a message indicating the missing review requirement.
3. **Given** a PR with all CI gates passing and an agent approval, **When** the author merges, **Then** the merge succeeds and the PR is recorded in the governance log.

### User Story 2 - Validate Constitution Compliance During Review (Priority: P1)

As a code reviewer (human or agent), I have a checklist enforced by tooling that covers all constitution review requirements so that nothing is missed.

**Why this priority**: Manual checklists drift. Automated enforcement ensures the constitution review checklist is applied to every PR without exception.

**Independent Test**: Open a PR that violates a constitution requirement (e.g., missing tests for new code), run the compliance check, and confirm the violation is flagged with a reference to the relevant constitution section.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR that adds code without corresponding tests, **When** the constitution compliance check runs, **Then** it flags the violation referencing the Testing Requirements section of the constitution.
2. **Given** a PR that introduces a file exceeding 500 lines, **When** the compliance check runs, **Then** it flags the file size violation referencing the Team Conventions section.
3. **Given** a PR that passes all compliance checks, **When** the review summary is generated, **Then** it includes a signed-off compliance attestation.

### User Story 3 - Self-Merge After All Gates Pass (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I can self-merge my PR after all required gates and reviews have passed so that I am not blocked by scheduling delays while still maintaining full governance.

**Why this priority**: The constitution allows self-merge after all gates pass. This enables velocity without compromising quality.

**Independent Test**: Open a PR, obtain agent approval, confirm all gates pass, self-merge, and verify the governance log records the self-merge with full gate attestation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR with all gates passing and agent approval, **When** the author self-merges, **Then** the merge succeeds and the governance log records the merge as self-merged with full attestation.
2. **Given** a PR where GCA was rate-limited and did not complete, **When** the author attempts self-merge, **Then** the merge is blocked until GCA re-review is requested and completes.

### User Story 4 - Document Exceptions with ADRs (Priority: P2)

As a developer requesting an exception to a constitution rule, I must create an ADR and obtain 3 approvals so that exceptions are traceable and time-bounded.

**Why this priority**: The constitution requires documented exceptions with approvals and sunset dates. This prevents governance erosion.

**Independent Test**: Open a PR that violates a constitution rule with an accompanying ADR, verify the system detects the violation, links to the ADR, and requires 3 approvals before allowing merge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR that violates a constitution rule, **When** an ADR is linked that documents the exception with a sunset date, **Then** the compliance check accepts the exception contingent on 3 approvals.
2. **Given** an exception ADR without a sunset date, **When** the compliance check runs, **Then** it rejects the exception and requires either a sunset date or an explicit permanence justification.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GCA or CodeRabbit is down or rate-limited? The system must block merge, notify the author, and automatically retry when the service recovers.
- How does the system handle conflicting review feedback from GCA and an agent reviewer? Both must be resolved -- the stricter finding takes precedence.
- What happens when a constitution amendment changes review requirements mid-PR? The PR must be re-evaluated against the updated constitution before merge.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Every PR MUST be blocked from merge until at least one agent reviewer has approved it.
- **FR-002**: GCA and CodeRabbit automated reviews MUST be configured as required status checks that block merge on failure or absence.
- **FR-003**: If an automated review tool is rate-limited or unavailable, the system MUST block merge and automatically request re-review when the tool recovers.
- **FR-004**: Self-merge MUST be permitted only when all CI quality gates (spec 021) pass AND all required reviews are approved.
- **FR-005**: A constitution compliance checker MUST validate each PR against the full code review checklist defined in the constitution: correctness, tests, docs, types, error handling, performance, security, anti-patterns, library preference, backward-compat avoidance, and regression risk.
- **FR-006**: The compliance checker MUST reference the specific constitution section for each finding.
- **FR-007**: Constitution exceptions MUST require a linked ADR with a sunset date (or explicit permanence justification) and 3 approvals before the exception is accepted.
- **FR-008**: Every merge MUST be recorded in a governance log with: PR number, author, reviewers, gate results, compliance attestation, exception ADRs (if any), and timestamp.
- **FR-009**: The governance log MUST be version-controlled and append-only within the repository.
- **FR-010**: Constitution amendments that affect review requirements MUST trigger re-evaluation of open PRs.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Automated review triggers MUST fire within 5 minutes of PR creation or update.
- **NFR-002**: The compliance checker MUST complete within 2 minutes for a typical PR.
- **NFR-003**: The governance log MUST be queryable for audit purposes (e.g., "show all self-merges in the last 30 days" or "show all exception ADRs").
- **NFR-004**: Review process configuration MUST be version-controlled alongside the codebase.

### Key Entities

- **Pull Request Review**: The aggregate review state of a PR including automated gate results, agent reviews, and compliance attestation.
- **Compliance Attestation**: A structured record confirming that a PR has been validated against every item in the constitution review checklist.
- **Governance Log Entry**: An append-only record of a merge event with full provenance (author, reviewers, gates, exceptions).
- **Exception ADR**: An architectural decision record documenting a deviation from the constitution with justification, approvals, and sunset date.
- **Review Gate**: A required status check (GCA, CodeRabbit, agent approval) that must pass before merge is permitted.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of merged PRs have at least one agent review approval and passing GCA/CodeRabbit gates in the governance log.
- **SC-002**: 100% of constitution exceptions on main are backed by an ADR with 3 approvals and a sunset date or permanence justification.
- **SC-003**: Zero PRs are merged while any required review gate is in a rate-limited, unavailable, or incomplete state.
- **SC-004**: The compliance checker catches 100% of file-size violations (>500 lines) and missing-test violations in validation runs.
- **SC-005**: Governance log entries exist for every merge to main with complete provenance fields.

## Assumptions

- GCA and CodeRabbit are available as GitHub integrations and can be configured as required status checks.
- The CI quality gates from spec 021 are operational and produce structured pass/fail results consumable by the review process.
- Agent reviewers are available (other agents in the project or automated review agents) to provide approvals.
- The constitution is the authoritative source for review checklist items and is version-controlled at `.kittify/memory/constitution.md`.
