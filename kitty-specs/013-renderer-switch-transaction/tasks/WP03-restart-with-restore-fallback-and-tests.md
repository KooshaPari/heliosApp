# Work Package Prompt: WP03 - Restart-With-Restore Fallback and End-to-End Tests

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Implement the restart-with-restore fallback path for renderer switches when hot-swap is unavailable.
- Implement degraded-but-safe mode for double-failure scenarios (rollback failure).
- Implement terminal creation queueing during active switch transactions.
- Deliver comprehensive fault injection, SLO validation, and Playwright end-to-end tests.

Success criteria:
- Restart-with-restore completes in under 8 seconds with full session recovery.
- Double-failure scenario enters degraded-but-safe mode preserving PTY streams headlessly.
- Terminal creation requests during active transactions are queued and drained after completion.
- All fault injection scenarios result in clean rollback or safe degraded mode.
- SLO timing tests pass at p95 for all switch paths.

## Context & Constraints

- Constitution: `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/.kittify/memory/constitution.md`
- Plan: `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/kitty-specs/013-renderer-switch-transaction/plan.md`
- Spec: `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/kitty-specs/013-renderer-switch-transaction/spec.md`
- Switch transaction: `apps/runtime/src/renderer/switch_transaction.ts` (WP01/WP02)
- Hot-swap: `apps/runtime/src/renderer/hot_swap.ts` (WP02)
- Rollback: `apps/runtime/src/renderer/rollback.ts` (WP02)
- PTY proxy: `apps/runtime/src/renderer/pty_stream_proxy.ts` (WP01)
- zmx checkpoint/restore: spec 012

Constraints:
- zmx checkpoint must capture scrollback, cursor, env, cwd for all active terminals.
- Degraded mode must never lose PTY streams; headless preservation is acceptable.
- Keep files under 500 lines.
- TypeScript + Bun runtime.

Implementation command:
- `spec-kitty implement WP03`

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T011 - Implement restart-with-restore execution path
- Purpose: provide the fallback switch path when hot-swap is unavailable, using zmx checkpoint data for full session recovery.
- Steps:
  1. Implement `executeRestartWithRestore(transaction, terminals, sourceAdapter, targetAdapter)` in `apps/runtime/src/renderer/restart_restore.ts`.
  2. Phase 1 - Checkpoint:
     a. Activate PTY stream proxy buffering for all terminals.
     b. Take zmx checkpoint snapshot for all active terminals (scrollback, cursor, env, cwd, terminal dimensions).
     c. Transition state machine to `restarting`.
     d. Verify checkpoint integrity before proceeding.
  3. Phase 2 - Teardown:
     a. Cleanly teardown the source renderer adapter.
     b. Continue buffering PTY output during teardown.
  4. Phase 3 - Start and restore:
     a. Initialize the target renderer adapter.
     b. Restore terminal state from zmx checkpoint (scrollback, cursor, env, cwd, dimensions).
     c. Replay PTY buffer to the target renderer.
     d. Verify all terminals are functional with target renderer.
  5. Phase 4 - Commit:
     a. Transition state machine to `committing` then `committed`.
     b. Switch PTY proxies back to passthrough mode.
  6. On any failure during phases 2-3, trigger rollback to source renderer using checkpoint data.
  7. Wire into the switch orchestrator as the non-hot-swap path.
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/src/renderer/restart_restore.ts`
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/src/renderer/switch_transaction.ts` (orchestrator wiring)
- Validation:
  - Integration test: restart-with-restore with 3 terminals, verify full state recovery.
  - Integration test: verify session context (scrollback, cursor, env, cwd) matches pre-switch state.
  - Timing test: verify completion under 8 seconds.
- Parallel: No.

### Subtask T012 - Implement degraded-but-safe mode for double-failure
- Purpose: handle the worst case where both the switch and rollback fail, preserving PTY streams headlessly.
- Steps:
  1. Add `degraded` state to the switch transaction state machine.
  2. Implement degraded mode entry in `apps/runtime/src/renderer/rollback.ts`:
     a. When rollback fails (cannot restore original renderer), enter degraded mode.
     b. Preserve all PTY streams in headless mode (PTY processes continue running without renderer).
     c. Emit `renderer.switch.degraded` event with details of both failures.
  3. Implement user notification:
     a. Surface a clear prompt to the user explaining the degraded state.
     b. Offer options: retry renderer initialization, restart the application, or continue headless.
  4. Implement recovery path from degraded mode:
     a. Allow the user to attempt renderer re-initialization from the degraded state.
     b. On success, transition from `degraded` to `committed` with PTY replay.
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/src/renderer/rollback.ts` (degraded mode)
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/src/renderer/switch_transaction.ts` (degraded state)
- Validation:
  - Integration test: inject failure in both target init and rollback, verify degraded mode entered.
  - Integration test: verify PTY processes continue running in headless mode.
  - Unit test: verify degraded event payload includes both failure reasons.
- Parallel: No.

### Subtask T013 - Implement terminal creation queueing during active transactions
- Purpose: prevent new terminal creation from interfering with an active switch transaction.
- Steps:
  1. Implement a terminal creation queue in the switch transaction module:
     a. When a switch transaction is active, intercept terminal creation requests.
     b. Queue the requests with their parameters.
     c. Return a pending promise to the caller.
  2. Implement queue drain:
     a. After transaction commits or rolls back, process queued creation requests in order.
     b. Resolve each pending promise with the creation result.
  3. Add timeout for queued requests: if the transaction takes longer than a configurable timeout, reject queued requests with an explanatory error.
  4. Wire into the terminal spawn path (spec 007 integration point).
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/src/renderer/switch_transaction.ts` (queue logic)
- Validation:
  - Unit test: queue a terminal creation during active transaction, verify it resolves after commit.
  - Unit test: queue during active transaction that rolls back, verify creation proceeds after rollback.
  - Unit test: queue timeout, verify rejection with clear error.
- Parallel: No.

### Subtask T014 - Add fault injection tests
- Purpose: validate that all failure modes result in clean rollback or safe degraded mode.
- Steps:
  1. Create `apps/runtime/tests/integration/renderer/fault_injection.test.ts`:
     a. Test: target renderer init failure -> rollback to original.
     b. Test: mid-swap renderer failure (after partial init) -> rollback.
     c. Test: PTY replay failure -> rollback.
     d. Test: rollback failure -> degraded-but-safe mode.
     e. Test: PTY buffer overflow during switch -> overflow telemetry, degraded proxy.
     f. Test: zmx checkpoint failure -> abort before any side effects.
     g. Test: zmx restore failure -> rollback to source.
  2. Use mock adapters with configurable failure injection points.
  3. Verify post-failure state for each scenario:
     a. Rollback scenarios: all terminals restored to pre-switch state.
     b. Degraded scenarios: all PTY processes alive, headless mode active.
  4. Verify correct lifecycle events emitted for each failure path.
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/tests/integration/renderer/fault_injection.test.ts`
- Validation:
  - All 7+ fault scenarios pass with correct post-failure state.
  - Lifecycle events verified for each scenario.
- Parallel: Yes (after T011/T012 are implemented).

### Subtask T015 - Add SLO validation tests
- Purpose: verify timing budgets for all switch paths at p95.
- Steps:
  1. Create `apps/runtime/tests/integration/renderer/slo_validation.test.ts`:
     a. Hot-swap SLO: run 20+ hot-swap iterations, assert p95 < 3 seconds.
     b. Restart-with-restore SLO: run 20+ iterations, assert p95 < 8 seconds.
     c. Rollback SLO: run 20+ rollback iterations (from injected failure), assert p95 < 5 seconds.
  2. Use realistic mock adapters with representative init/teardown timing.
  3. Test with varying terminal counts (1, 5, 10) to validate scaling behavior.
  4. Record timing distributions for review.
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/runtime/tests/integration/renderer/slo_validation.test.ts`
- Validation:
  - All three SLO assertions pass at p95.
  - Timing distributions are recorded and available for review.
- Parallel: Yes (after T011 is implemented).

### Subtask T016 - Add Playwright end-to-end tests
- Purpose: validate the full switch workflow including UI feedback from the user's perspective.
- Steps:
  1. Create `apps/desktop/tests/e2e/renderer/switch_flow.test.ts`:
     a. Test: trigger switch from settings panel, verify progress indicator appears.
     b. Test: hot-swap completes, verify active renderer indicator updates.
     c. Test: switch fails, verify failure notification with rollback confirmation.
     d. Test: verify terminal content is continuous across a successful switch.
  2. Create `apps/desktop/tests/e2e/renderer/switch_edge_cases.test.ts`:
     a. Test: attempt switch during active switch, verify rejection message.
     b. Test: create terminal during switch, verify it appears after switch completes.
  3. Use Playwright to drive the ElectroBun UI and verify visual state.
  4. Capture screenshots at key points for visual regression baseline.
- Files:
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/desktop/tests/e2e/renderer/switch_flow.test.ts`
  - `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/heliosApp/apps/desktop/tests/e2e/renderer/switch_edge_cases.test.ts`
- Validation:
  - All Playwright tests pass.
  - Visual regression screenshots captured.
- Parallel: Yes (after T011/T012/T013 are implemented).

## Test Strategy

- Fault injection tests: mock adapters with configurable failure points.
- SLO tests: repeated iterations with timing assertion at p95.
- Playwright tests: full UI-driven workflows with visual verification.
- Aim for >=85% line coverage across all renderer switch modules.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: zmx checkpoint/restore timing exceeds 8-second budget.
- Mitigation: checkpoint only active terminals, parallelize restore operations.
- Risk: degraded mode leaves user confused about system state.
- Mitigation: clear user notification with actionable recovery options.

## Review Guidance

- Confirm restart-with-restore uses zmx checkpoint data correctly.
- Confirm degraded mode preserves all PTY processes.
- Confirm terminal creation queue drains correctly after both commit and rollback.
- Confirm SLO tests use realistic timing and sufficient iterations.
- Confirm Playwright tests cover both happy and failure paths.
